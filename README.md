# Python SDK for CKB

Python CKB is an experimental project that aims to provide human-friendly interfaces for common CKB operations. Note that Python CKB is not a complete SDK, but only implements the CKB functions that I am interested in.

Features:

- No third-party dependencies. All code is visible.
- Incredibly simple.

Read the example to learn about the capabilities of the Python SDK:

- `capacity_collection.py`: collect scattered utxo into one utxo.
- `generate_account.py`: shows how to generate address from private key.
- `get_capacity.py`: check balances.
- `transfer_capacity_pullup.py`: transfer all the ckb in one account to another.
- `transfer_capacity.py`: transfer specified ckb in one account to another.
